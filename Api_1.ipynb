      "🔹 OpenAI Response:\n",
      " Sure! Let’s break it down step by step in simple terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI):**\n",
      "   - **What it is:** AI is the big umbrella term. It refers to the idea of creating machines or software that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.\n",
      "   - **Examples:** AI includes things like recognizing speech, playing chess, understanding language, or making decisions.\n",
      "   - **Key point:** AI is the broadest concept, and it includes many different approaches and techniques to make machines \"smart.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Machine Learning (ML):**\n",
      "   - **What it is:** Machine learning is a subset of AI. It’s a way to teach machines to learn from data instead of being explicitly programmed for every single task.\n",
      "   - **How it works:** You give the machine a lot of data, and it finds patterns or relationships in that data. Then, it uses those patterns to make predictions or decisions.\n",
      "   - **Examples:** \n",
      "     - A spam filter that learns to recognize spam emails based on examples of spam and non-spam emails.\n",
      "     - A recommendation system (like Netflix or Amazon) that suggests movies or products based on your past behavior.\n",
      "   - **Key point:** Machine learning is one way to achieve AI by letting machines learn from data.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Deep Learning (DL):**\n",
      "   - **What it is:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. It uses a special kind of algorithm called a **neural network**, which is inspired by how the human brain works.\n",
      "   - **How it works:** Deep learning models have many layers of \"neurons\" (hence the term \"deep\"). These layers process data step by step, learning increasingly complex patterns. For example, in image recognition:\n",
      "     - The first layer might detect edges.\n",
      "     - The next layer might detect shapes.\n",
      "     - The final layers might recognize objects like \"cat\" or \"dog.\"\n",
      "   - **Examples:**\n",
      "     - Self-driving cars use deep learning to recognize pedestrians, traffic signs, and other vehicles.\n",
      "     - Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa use deep learning to understand and respond to your voice.\n",
      "   - **Key point:** Deep learning is a more advanced and powerful type of machine learning, especially for tasks like image recognition, speech processing, and natural language understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### How They Relate:\n",
      "Think of it like this:\n",
      "- **AI** is the goal: making machines smart.\n",
      "- **Machine learning** is one way to achieve AI: teaching machines to learn from data.\n",
      "- **Deep learning** is a more advanced type of machine learning: using neural networks with many layers to solve really complex problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In short:\n",
      "- **AI** is the big picture.\n",
      "- **ML** is a tool within AI.\n",
      "- **DL** is a specialized tool within ML.\n"

FINISHED PRODUCT INFORMATION Brand Murray St Product/s Ice Cream Sticks and Sandwiches Competitor Products Connoisseur Classic Vanilla Ice Cream 4 Pack | 400mL Claims Material needs to be compliant for Codex Standard for Milk Chocolate. Project Objective To develop a milk chocolate coating for the purpose of enrobing ice cream sticks and sandwiches. The chocolate must have excellent melting and coating characteristics, be stable for frozen applications, and deliver a premium flavour and texture experience. It must be able to hold inclusions in the coating. When consumed, it must provide a 'snap' when bitten into. Target Shelf Life 2 Years (finished goods) 3.
